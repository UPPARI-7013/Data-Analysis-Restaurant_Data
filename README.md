# 📊 Data Analysis Internship Projects – Level 1 & Level 2

Welcome to my Data Analysis project repository!  
This repository contains two practical data analysis tasks completed as part of a Data Analyst Internship Program. The goal of these tasks is to demonstrate proficiency in Python-based data analysis, including data cleaning, visualization, and text processing using real-world review data.

## 🗂️ Project Overview

### 🔹 Level 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

In this notebook, the focus is on understanding the structure of the dataset and uncovering basic insights.

#### Key Tasks:
- Loading and exploring the dataset using `pandas`
- Generating summary statistics
- Handling missing or inconsistent data
- Creating data visualizations using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`
  - Bar plots, histograms, pie charts, etc.
- Basic interpretation of trends and distributions

### 🔹 Level 2: Textual Data Analysis and Insight Extraction

In this advanced notebook, the goal is to dive deeper into textual review data and uncover patterns and sentiment-based insights.

#### Key Tasks:
- Extracting and cleaning text from review columns
- Using `nltk` for tokenization, stopword removal, and frequency analysis
- Identifying most common positive and negative keywords
- Analyzing review length in relation to rating
- Generating word clouds to visualize frequent terms
