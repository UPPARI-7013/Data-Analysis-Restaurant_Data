Data-Analysis-Level-1.ipynb:
Covers basic data exploration and visualization using a given dataset.
Includes:

Data loading

Basic EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)

Summary statistics

Simple visualizations (bar, pie, histogram, etc.)

Data-Analysis-Level-2.ipynb:
Builds upon the first level with more in-depth analysis.
Includes:

Keyword extraction from reviews

Sentiment analysis

Review length vs. rating correlation

Identification of most common positive/negative words

Dataset .csv:
The dataset used for analysis, containing customer review data.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NLTK, etc.)

Jupyter Notebook

CSV data handling

📊 Objectives
Apply real-world data analysis techniques

Generate insights from text and numerical data

Practice data visualization and storytelling

🚀 Getting Started
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-analysis-projects.git
Open the notebooks in Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook.

Run the cells sequentially to follow the analysis.

📌 Notes
Make sure to install necessary packages using pip install -r requirements.txt (if applicable).

Replace "Dataset .csv" with a properly named file (e.g., dataset.csv) for cleaner usage.
